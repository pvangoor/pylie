# pylie: Lie groups in Python

This package implements common Lie groups in python.
The idea is to have Lie groups interact as you would expect: multiplication operators are defined for group products as well as default group actions on vectors.
There are also some analysis and plotting tools.

## Installation

Run setup and install:

`python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel && python3 -m pip install dist/pylie-0.1.0.tar.gz`
